At this point, it seems certain. Donald Trump will be the next President of
the United States. A mere 8 hours ago, this seemed unimaginable. The polls
all predicted a Clinton victory, but that is not the reality we will live for
the next 4 years. Instead we will have a Republican House, a Republican Senate,
and a Republican President. Oh and I forgot to mention, a conservative Supreme
Court. All of the accomplishments under President Obama are now in jeopardy.

To begin lets list a few of Obama's accomplishments that are now in jeopardy.
The first three of which, I will cover in more detail below.

* The Affordable Care Act (2010) - provides healthcare to low-income persons
  and those with preexisting conditions.
* Reversed torture policies - eliminated 'enhanced interrogation'
* Iran nuclear deal - [Yes, it's a good thing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-accepting-the-iran-nuclear-deal-is-a-no-brainer/2015/08/13/06adba26-3c5c-11e5-b3ac-8a79bc44e5e2_story.html)
* Wall Street Reform - re-regulating the financial industry
* Improved America's image abroad
* Removed Banks from Student Loan Programs
* Boosted Fuel Efficiency Standards


### Problems with Polls

So how did we get here? Well let's first take a look at what went wrong with
the polls.
The polling predictions all rely on one base truth, past elections. And if
we've learned anything over the past year and a half, it's that this election
is not like previous elections. Trump galvanized a populaton of white
working-class voters that don't frequently vote. At the same time, a surge
of Latinx voters did not offset the swell fo support for Trump.

## Destroying Obama's Legacy

### Repealling Obamacare

Donald has repeatedly touted that he will "repeal Obamacare on day one" and has
yet to put forward his "far better" plan. Repealing Obamacare will cause
22 million people to [lose health insurance](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/costestimate/hr3762senatepassed.pdf),
so it's unlikely they will repeal it immediately. Obamacare has one main
problem, it didn't get everyone. Many young people refused to sign up and
instead paid the fine associated with it. As result, going in to 2017,
Obamacare premiums are set to go up [25%](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nickclements/2016/10/25/obamacare-premiums-increase-25-is-the-death-spiral-here/#73f8779414d7).
The real problem behind the industry of health insurance is the private companies.
In order to drive up profits, insurance companies have driven up costs
to [2.5 times more than most developed nations](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/health-costs-how-the-us-compares-with-other-countries/).
This cost makes health without Obamacare prohibitively expensive.
But taxpayers still have to pick up the tab when an uninsured person gets
medical attention and can't pay for it.
As a result, having health insurance provided by the government through required
taxes is the cheapest option because they are not driven to profit, costs are spread
equally, and everyone gets healthcare. Repealling Obamacare will lead to the
exact opposite, more uninsured people will be unable to pay their medical bills
and this will be passed on to the rest of us anyways. By providing everyone with
healthcare, we can avoid high-cost procedures necessary when an uninsured person
avoids healthcare for a long period.

### Restarting Torture Programs

Trump has said he will bring back waterboarding and worse. He has also advocated
for the torture of the families of suspected terrorists (which is in fact a war
crime). All of which take us back to a post-9/11 and pre-Obama period of fear,
hatred, and bigotry. Firstly, the entire notion of torture is wrong and should
never be used. But the idea that terrorism can go away by a more liberal use
of torture is absurd. Torturing families will merely create more terrorists,
and it will increase tensions with communities in the Middle East that our
military operations have already thrust into chaos.

### Withdrawing from the Iran Deal

The Iran Deal significantly decreased Iran's ability to obtain a nuclear
weapon in the next decade. It has been widely criticized for ending after
such a short period of time, but Iran was a mere 6 months from being able
to construct a bomb before the deal and are now much further away. As with
North Korea, Iran immensely increased its nuclear program after being labelled
part of the "Axis of Evil" by President George W. Bush. Pursuing a more
diplomatic solution in a region we have invaded, exploited and colonized for decades
is the only alternative to perpetual animosity.

## Trump's Inherent Danger

While Trump can do real damage to the above accomplishments as well as other 
Obama initiatives such as [DACA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Action_for_Childhood_Arrivals),
his real danger comes from the lasting impact he will have on
our society. As has been covered over and over and over again throughout this
campaign season Trump is a dangerous President because he legitimizing racism
and sexism. It's "ok" in Trump's America to want to deport all the undocumented
immigrants, it's "ok" in Trump's America to want to infringe on the liberties
of African-Americans by reinstituting Stop and Frisk, it's "ok" to want to
ban an entire religious group from our country, it's "ok" to treat women as
nothing more than pretty objects to please the crazed fantasies of deranged men.
These things will last. And that is scary.
