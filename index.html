        I'm currently a student at Pomona College studying Computer Science. I'm also involved with the Theatre Department and was a Stage Manager for the production of Vera Stark in Fall 2015. I have interned at Puppet and Delaris (both based in Portland). In Fall 2016, I will be doing Computer Science research regarding the POSIX shell at Pomona College.
